description=Runs a short script to change notification snooze times at boot. By default, it sets them to 3/7/15/24hrs. Modify the integers in "/data/CNSvalues.txt" to customise. "def" refers to the default snooze setting, and must be the same as one of the other four values. Variables a, b, c, and d refer to the four value options, given as integers representing seconds. Reboot to apply changes (or run this module's service.sh from a terminal emulator). See Github for more details.
